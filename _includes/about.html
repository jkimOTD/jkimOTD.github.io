My name is Judy Kim and I am an occupational therapy doctorate student at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences. <br><br>I'm excited to share my capstone project with you: creating an injury prevention program specifically for flutists through an occupational therapy lens. My goal with this program is to shine a light on overuse injuries and help to facilitate the longevity and prosperity of flutists in their careers. </p>
